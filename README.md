# Connect2IC
A toolkit which makes it trivial to support any wallet or identity provider, and make authenticated calls to canisters.

## Introduction
There are many new wallets coming out and adding support for these isn't always easy. Connect2ic allows you to get fully working auth for the most popular providers with only a few lines of code. Use the already styled `<ConnectDialog />` component or feel free to create your own. Connect2ic gives you full control and additionally provides you with convenient helper utilities such as `useCanister()` and `useTransfer()`.

# React

## Quickstart

Following these steps will give you fully working auth with a `<ConnectButton />` and `<ConnectDialog />` as shown in the top image.

**1.** Install the necessary packages

```
npm i -S @connect2ic/core @connect2ic/react
```


**2.** Wrap your app with the Provider and optionally pass in canister definitions (as generated by dfx)

```jsx
import { defaultProviders } from "@connect2ic/core/providers"
import { Connect2ICProvider } from "@connect2ic/react"
import "@connect2ic/core/style.css"
import * as counter from "canisters/counter"

const AppRoot = () => (
  <Connect2ICProvider
    canisters={{
      counter,
    }}
    providers={defaultProviders}
  >
    <App />
  </Connect2ICProvider>
)

```

**3.** Place the components

```jsx
import { ConnectButton, ConnectDialog, Connect2ICProvider, useConnect } from "@connect2ic/react"

function App() {
  
  const { isConnected, principal, activeProvider } = useConnect({
    onConnect: () => {
      // Signed in
    },
    onDisconnect: () => {
      // Signed out
    }
  })

  return (
    <>
      <ConnectButton />
      <ConnectDialog dark={false} />
    </>
  )
}

```

**4.** Done. Now customize it

Explore the remaining sections for further customization. Most likely you will need the
`useConnect()` hook next.

## Vue

**1.** Install the necessary packages

```
npm i -S @connect2ic/core @connect2ic/vue
```

**2.** Wrap your app with the Provider and optionally pass in canister definitions (as generated by dfx)

Optionally pass in canister definitions as well (as generated by dfx)

```html

<script setup>
  import * as counter from "canisters/counter"
  import { defaultProviders } from "@connect2ic/core/providers"
  import { Connect2ICProvider } from "@connect2ic/vue"
  import "@connect2ic/core/style.css"
</script>

<template>
  <Connect2ICProvider
    :canisters="{counter}"
    :providers="defaultProviders"
  >
    <App />
  </Connect2ICProvider>
</template>

```

**3.** Place the components

```html

<script setup>
  import { ConnectButton, ConnectDialog } from "@connect2ic/vue"
</script>

<template>
  <div class="my-app">
    <ConnectButton />
    <ConnectDialog />
  </div>
</template>

```

**4.** Done. Now customize it

Explore the remaining sections for further customization. Most likely you will need the
`useConnect()` composable next.

## Svelte

**1.** Install the necessary packages

```
npm i -S @connect2ic/core @connect2ic/svelte
```

**2.** Wrap your app with the Provider and optionally pass in canister definitions (as generated by dfx)

Optionally pass in canister definitions as well (as generated by dfx)

```html

<script>
  import * as counter from "canisters/counter"
  import { defaultProviders } from "@connect2ic/core/providers"
  import { Connect2ICProvider } from "@connect2ic/svelte"
  import "@connect2ic/core/style.css"
</script>

<Connect2ICProvider
  canisters={{ counter }}
  providers={defaultProviders}
>
  <App />
</Connect2ICProvider>

```

**3.** Place the components

```html

<script>
  import { ConnectButton, ConnectDialog } from "@connect2ic/svelte"
</script>

<div class="my-app">
  <ConnectButton />
  <ConnectDialog />
</div>

```

**4.** Done. Now customize it

Explore the remaining sections for further customization. Most likely you will need the
`useConnect()` store next.
